# FunkiniOS, a port of Friday Night Funkin' to iOS Devices (and Safari)

### It's finally ready! This is my native port of Friday Night Funkin' by ninjamuffin99, PhantomArcade and evilsk8r to iOS devices/Safari!

What I've done:
- add scaling for most iOS devices so the game looks and plays well on almost every iOS device. 
- reduced RAM usage by ~70% in some levels by compressing assets and making spritesheets smaller through exporting custom texture atlases based off the .fla file released by PhantomArcade.
- other fixes that probably suck

Install using AltStore or Filza & AppSync if jailbroken.

**If you have an iPad/iPhone 11 or newer, head over to https://hadobedo.github.io/ to try out the mobile version. This is relatively untested but should work, but don't expect stability.**
